If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a day. Only a bheur hag can use a graystaff.\r\n\r\n***Ice Walk.*** The hag can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra moment.\r\n\r\n***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks).

A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n\r\n>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n\r\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n\r\n* 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n\r\n* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n\r\n* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n\r\n* 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n\r\n* 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n\r\n* 6th level (1 slot): eyebite\r\n\r\n>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\n\r\n***Variant: Death Coven.*** For a death coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:\r\n\r\n1st level (4 slots): false life, inflict wounds\r\n\r\n2nd level (3 slots): gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement\r\n\r\n3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, revivify, speak with dead\r\n\r\n4th level (3 slots): blight, death ward\r\n\r\n5th level (2 slots): contagion, raise dead\r\n\r\n6th level (1 slot): circle of death\r\n\r\n***Variant: Nature Coven.*** For a nature coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:\r\n\r\n1st level (4 slots): entangle, speak with animals\r\n\r\n2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, moonbeam, spike growth\r\n\r\n3rd level (3 slots): call lightning, plant growth\r\n\r\n4th level (3 slots): dominate beast, grasping vine\r\n\r\n5th level (2 slots): insect plague, tree stride\r\n\r\n6th level (1 slot): wall of thorns\r\n\r\n***Variant: Prophecy Coven.*** For a prophecy coven, replace the spell list of the hags' Shared Spellcasting trait with the folllowing spells:\r\n\r\n1st level (4 slots): bane, bless\r\n\r\n2nd level (3 slots): augury, detect thoughts\r\n\r\n3rd level (3 slots): calirvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection\r\n\r\n4th level (3 slots): arcane eye, locate creature\r\n\r\n5th level (2 slots): geas, legend lore\r\n\r\n6th level (1 slot): true seeing\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Each creature of the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.","Black Abishai":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Black Abishai\"\r\ntags: [medium, fiend, cr7, mordenkainens-tome-of-foes]\r\npage_number: 160\r\ncha: 11 (0)\r\nwis: 16 (+3)\r\nint: 13 (+1)\r\ncon: 14 (+2)\r\ndex: 17 (+3)\r\nstr: 14 (+2)\r\nsize: Medium fiend (devil)\r\nalignment: lawful evil\r\nchallenge: \"7 (2900 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"Draconic, Infernal, telepathy 120 ft.\"\r\nsenses: \"darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16\"\r\nskills: \"Perception +6, Stealth +6\"\r\ndamage_immunities: \"acid, fire, poison\"\r\nsaving_throws: \"Dex +6, Wis +6\"\r\nspeed: \"30 ft., fly 40 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"58  (9d8 + 18)\"\r\narmor_class: \"15 (natural armor)\"\r\ncondition_immunities: \"poisoned\"\r\ndamage_resistances: \"cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't silvered\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.\r\n\r\n***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\r\n\r\n***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.\r\n\r\n***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the abishai can take the Hide action as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack*** The abishai makes three attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its bite.\r\n\r\n***Scimitar*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\r\n\r\nDisguises.\r\n\r\nSome genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n\r\nWishes.\r\n\r\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.\r\n\r\n***Fist.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\r\n\r\nDisguises.\r\n\r\nSome genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n\r\nWishes.\r\n\r\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.\r\n\r\n***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\r\n\r\nA creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.","Dolphin":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Dolphin\"\r\ntags: [medium, beast, cr1/8, volos-guide]\r\ncha: 7 (-2)\r\nwis: 12 (+1)\r\nint: 6 (-2)\r\ncon: 13 (+1)\r\ndex: 13 (+1)\r\nstr: 14 (+2)\r\nsize: Medium beast\r\nalignment: unaligned\r\nchallenge: \"1/8 (25 XP)\"\r\nsenses: \"blindsight 60 ft.\"\r\nskills: \"Perception +3\"\r\nspeed: \"0 ft., swim 60 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"11 (2d8+2)\"\r\narmor_class: \"12 (natural armor)\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Charge.*** If the dolphin moves at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.\r\n\r\n***Hold Breath.*** The dolphin can hold its breath for 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\r\n\r\nDisguises.\r\n\r\nSome genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n\r\nWishes.\r\n\r\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The efreeti makes two scimitar attacks or uses its Hurl Flame twice.\r\n\r\n***Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Until the psychic link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer incapacitated, and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart, with no consequences to the target. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.\r\n\r\n***Sense Thoughts.*** The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's reasoning, its emotional state, and thoughts that loom large in its mind (including things the target worries about, loves, or hates). The elder brain can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the elder brain succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.\r\n\r\n### Legendary Actions\r\n\r\nThe elder brain can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in sticky, steaming mud. While it is coated in this way, the target's speed is halved, it can't use reactions, and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The effect lasts for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the target is immersed in water.\r\n\r\n***Gaze of Corruption (Recharge 6).*** The cultist targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\n\r\n***Haask's Presence (1/Day).*** The cultist transforms into a Tiny, leech-like being and teleports onto the shoulder of a humanoid that it can see within 30 feet of it. The targeted humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the cultist. While the target is charmed, the cultist has control of it on the target's next turn. At the end of that turn, the cultist teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it and returns to its normal form. The cultist can't be targeted directly by any attack or other effect while it's in the slug-like form, but it is subject to areas of effect as normal.\r\n\r\n***Radiant Flames (1/Day).*** Multihued flame surrounds the cultist for 1 minute, until the cultist is incapacitated or dies, or until the cultist extinguishes the flame (no action required). While inflamed, the cultist has telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and it can teleport as a bonus action up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the cultist must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Tharizdun's Spark (Recharge 6).*** As a bonus action, the cultist touches a simple or martial weapon or a natural weapon, if it has one.

This simulacrum appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. The oblex can impersonate 2d6 + 1 different creatures, each one tethered to its body by a strand of slime that can extend up to 120 feet away. For all practical purposes, the simulacrum is the oblex, meaning the oblex occupies its space and the simulacrum's space simultaneously. The slimy tether is immune to damage, but it is severed if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the oblex's main body and the simulacrum. The simulacrum disappears if the tether is severed.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack*** The elder oblex makes two pseudopod attacks and uses Eat Memories.\r\n\r\n***Pseudopod*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.\r\n\r\n***Eat Memories*** The oblex targets one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 44 (8d10) psychic damage and become memory drained until it finishes a short or long rest or until it benefits from the greater restoration or heal spell. Constructs, oozes, plants, and undead succeed on the save automatically.\r\nWhile memory drained, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from any ability check or attack roll it makes. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the d4 becomes a d6, the d6 becomes a d8, and so on until the die becomes a d20, at which point the target becomes unconscious for 1 hour. The effect then ends.\r\nWhen an oblex causes a target to become memory drained, the oblex learns all the languages the target knows and gains all its proficiencies, except any saving throw proficiencies.","Elder Tempest":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Elder Tempest\"\r\ntags: [gargantuan, elemental, cr23, mordenkainens-tome-of-foes]\r\npage_number: 200\r\ncha: 18 (+4)\r\nwis: 21 (+5)\r\nint: 2 (-4)\r\ncon: 23 (+6)\r\ndex: 28 (+9)\r\nstr: 23 (+6)\r\nsize: Gargantuan elemental\r\nalignment: neutral\r\nchallenge: \"23 (50,000 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"-\"\r\nsenses: \"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15\"\r\ndamage_immunities: \"lightning, poison, thunder\"\r\nsaving_throws: \"Wis +12, Cha +11\"\r\nspeed: \"0 ft., fly 120 ft.

Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.\r\nIn addition, strong winds swirl in the area covered by the storm. The winds impose disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. The winds extinguish open flames and disperse fog.\r\n\r\n***Siege Monster.*** The tempest deals double damage to objects and structures.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack*** The tempest makes two attacks with its thunderous slam.\r\n\r\n***Thunderous Slam*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.

If a thrown target collides with an immovable object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown before impact.

She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\r\n\r\nAt will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery\r\n\r\n***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.\r\n\r\n***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n\r\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n\r\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n\r\n* 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n\r\n* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n\r\n* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n\r\n* 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n\r\n* 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n\r\n* 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n\r\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\r\n\r\n***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\r\n\r\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.\r\n\r\n***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.","Green Slaad":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Green Slaad\"\r\ntags: [large, aberration, cr8, monster-manual]\r\ncha: 12 (+1)\r\nwis: 8 (-1)\r\nint: 11 (0)\r\ncon: 16 (+3)\r\ndex: 15 (+2)\r\nstr: 18 (+4)\r\nsize: Large aberration (shapechanger)\r\nalignment: chaotic neutral\r\nchallenge: \"8 (3,900 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"Slaad, telepathy 60 ft.\"\r\nsenses: \"blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft.\"\r\nskills: \"Arcana +3, Perception +2\"\r\nspeed: \"30 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"127 (15d10+45)\"\r\narmor_class: \"16 (natural armor)\"\r\ndamage_resistances: \"acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Shapechanger.*** The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form.

The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.\r\n\r\nCertain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.\r\n\r\nA greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.\r\n\r\nSomeone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff.

The hellfire engine spews acidic flame in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) fire damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (1d10) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage at the end of their turns. An affected creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to scrape off the burning fuel.\r\n* Lightning Flail. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) lightning damage. Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n* Thunder Cannon. The hellfire engine targets a point within 120 feet of it that it can see. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (2d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\nIf the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in 1d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a wish spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.","Helmed Horror":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Helmed Horror\"\r\ntags: [medium, construct, cr4, monster-manual]\r\ncha: 10 (0)\r\nwis: 10 (0)\r\nint: 10 (0)\r\ncon: 16 (+3)\r\ndex: 13 (+1)\r\nstr: 18 (+4)\r\nsize: Medium construct\r\nalignment: unaligned\r\nchallenge: \"4 (1,100 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"understands the languages of its creator but can't speak\"\r\nsenses: \"blindsight 60 ft.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\r\n\r\nWishes.\r\n\r\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\r\n\r\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The marid makes two trident attacks.\r\n\r\n***Trident.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.

The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.\r\n\r\nSoul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).\r\n\r\n***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n\r\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n\r\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n\r\n* 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n\r\n* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n\r\n* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n\r\n* 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n\r\n* 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n\r\n* 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n\r\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Claws (Hag Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.\r\n\r\n***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.\r\n\r\n***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a heartstone in her possession.\r\n\r\n***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.","Nightmare":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Nightmare\"\r\ntags: [large, fiend, cr3, monster-manual]\r\ncha: 15 (+2)\r\nwis: 13 (+1)\r\nint: 10 (0)\r\ncon: 16 (+3)\r\ndex: 15 (+2)\r\nstr: 18 (+4)\r\nsize: Large fiend\r\nalignment: neutral evil\r\nchallenge: \"3 (700 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"understands Abyssal, Common, and Infernal but can't speak\"\r\ndamage_immunities: \"fire\"\r\nspeed: \"60 ft., fly 90 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"68 (8d10+24)\"\r\narmor_class: \"13 (natural armor)\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Confer Fire Resistance.*** The nightmare can grant resistance to fire damage to anyone riding it.\r\n\r\n***Illumination.*** The nightmare sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\r\n\r\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.\r\n\r\n***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.\r\n\r\nA coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.\r\n\r\n***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:\r\n\r\n* 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness\r\n\r\n* 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object\r\n\r\n* 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt\r\n\r\n* 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph\r\n\r\n* 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying\r\n\r\n* 6th level (1 slot): eye bite\r\n\r\nFor casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.\r\n\r\n***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\r\n\r\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.\r\n\r\n***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 ft. of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.\r\n\r\n***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\r\n\r\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.","Sea Horse":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Sea Horse\"\r\ntags: [tiny, beast, cr0, monster-manual]\r\ncha: 2 (-4)\r\nwis: 10 (0)\r\nint: 1 (-5)\r\ncon: 8 (-1)\r\ndex: 12 (+1)\r\nstr: 1 (-5)\r\nsize: Tiny beast\r\nalignment: unaligned\r\nchallenge: \"0 (10 XP)\"\r\nspeed: \"swim 20 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"1 (1d4-1)\"\r\narmor_class: \"11\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Water Breathing.*** The sea horse can breathe only underwater.","Sea Lion":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Sea Lion\"\r\ntags: [large, monstrosity, cr5, tales-from-the-yawning-portal]\r\ncha: 8 (-1)\r\nwis: 12 (+1)\r\nint: 3 (-4)\r\ncon: 15 (+2)\r\ndex: 15 (+2)\r\nstr: 17 (+3)\r\nsize: Large monstrosity\r\nalignment: unaligned\r\nchallenge: \"5 (1,800 XP)\"\r\nskills: \"Perception +4, Stealth +5\"\r\nspeed: \"10 ft., swim 40 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"90 (12d10+24)\"\r\narmor_class: \"15 (natural armor)\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Source.*** tales from the yawning portal,  page 242\r\n\r\n***Amphibious.*** The sea lion can breathe air and water.\r\n\r\n***Keen Smell.*** The sea lion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.\r\n\r\n***Pack Tactics.*** The sea lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the sea lion's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.\r\n\r\n***Swimming Leap.*** With a 10-foot swimming start, the sea lion can long jump out of or across the water up to 25 feet.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack.*** The sea lion makes three attacks: one bite attack and two claw attacks.\r\n\r\n***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\r\n\r\n***Children of the Night (1/day).*** Strahd magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or swarms rats, provided that the sun isn't up.

The vampire has the following wizard spells prepared:\r\n\r\n* Cantrips (at will): mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost\r\n\r\n* 1st level (4 slots): comprehend languages, fog cloud, sleep\r\n\r\n* 2nd level (3 slots): detect thoughts, gust of wind, mirror image\r\n\r\n* 3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, bestow curse, nondetection\r\n\r\n* 4th level (3 slots): blight, greater invisibility\r\n\r\n* 5th level (1 slot): dominate person\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).*** The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.\r\n\r\n***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).\r\n\r\n***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.\r\n\r\n***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.\r\n\r\nEach time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.\r\n\r\n***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up.

On a failed save, one such item worn or carried by the creature (the target's choice) magically deteriorates, taking a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers, and the zorbo gains a +l bonus to AC until the start of its next turn. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield or magic item that drops to a 0 AC increase is destroyed.","Zuggtmoy":"---\r\nlayout: creature\r\nname: \"Zuggtmoy\"\r\ntags: [large, fiend, cr23, mordenkainens-tome-of-foes]\r\npage_number: 157\r\ncha: 24 (+7)\r\nwis: 19 (+4)\r\nint: 20 (+5)\r\ncon: 18 (+4)\r\ndex: 15 (+2)\r\nstr: 22 (+6)\r\nsize: Large fiend (demon)\r\nalignment: chaotic evil\r\nchallenge: \"23 (50,000 XP)\"\r\nlanguages: \"all, telepathy 120 ft.\"\r\nsenses: \"truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 21\"\r\nskills: \"Perception +11\"\r\ndamage_immunities: \"poison; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks\"\r\nsaving_throws: \"Dex +9, Con +11, Wis +11\"\r\nspeed: \"30 ft.\"\r\nhit_points: \"304  (32d10 + 128)\"\r\narmor_class: \"18 (natural armor)\"\r\ncondition_immunities: \"charmed, exhaustion, frightened, poisoned\"\r\ndamage_resistances: \"cold, fire, lightning\"\r\n---\r\n\r\n***Innate Spellcasting.*** Zuggtmoy's spellcasting ability is Charisma. She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\r\n* At will: detect magic, locate animals or plants, ray of sickness\r\n* 3/day each: dispel magic, ensnaring strike, entangle, plant growth\r\n* 1/day each: etherealness, teleport\r\n\r\n***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zuggtmoy fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.\r\n\r\n***Magic Resistance.*** Zuggtmoy has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\r\n\r\n***Magic Weapons.*** Zuggtmoy's weapon attacks are magical.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\n\r\n***Multiattack*** Zuggtmoy makes three pseudopod attacks.\r\n\r\n***Pseudopod*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.\r\n\r\n***Infestation Spores (3/Day)*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual).\r\n\r\n***Mind Control Spores (Recharge 5-6)*** Zuggtmoy releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on her, and it lingers for 1 minute. Humanoids and beasts in the cloud when it appears, or that enter it later, must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the influence of Zuggtmoy for 24 hours. While infected in this way, the creature is charmed by her and can't be reinfected by these spores.\r\n\r\n### Legendary Actions\r\n\r\nZuggtmoy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Zuggtmoy regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.\r\n\r\n***Attack*** Zuggtmoy makes one pseudopod attack.\r\n\r\n***Exert Will*** One creature charmed by Zuggtmoy that she can see must use its reaction to move up to its speed as she directs or to make a weapon attack against a target that she designates."}
